## Description
Created a variant of the game Asteroids using the original framework. The goal of the game is to destroy asteroids while player driving a spaceship and to score as many points as possible until lose. The player initially has 3 lives. For every 10.000 points player is added one life, also possible to resurrect after death, if the last shots earn an extra life. After losing a life, the player becomes invulnerable for 5 seconds. Next level occurs after the destruction of all asteroids on the level.
Asteroids are divided into 3 types:
Size | Hits for destruction | Score
--- | --- | ---
Large | 3 | 300
Medium | 2 | 200
Small | 1 | 100

When hit by an asteroid, its boundaries darken. When a large or medium asteroid is destroyed, two smaller asteroids appear in place of the destroyed one.
